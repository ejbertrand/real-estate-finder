# Superheroes-Collection

This project is a real-estate finder that reads from a JSON database of possible rental homes.

## Pre-requirements

1. Have Node.js already installed
2. Install JSON-Server with the following command: `npm install -g json-server`.

## Loading JSON database and development servers

Execute both commands inside the directory of the project:

First run `json-server --watch db.json` to load a JSON database server that will expose an API to access it, on the address `http://localhost:3000/`.

In a separate terminal, run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## ENJOY!
