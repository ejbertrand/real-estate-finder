# Superheroes-Collection

This project is a real-estate finder that reads from a JSON database of possible rental homes.

## Loading JSON database and development servers

First run `json-server --watch db.json` to load a JSON database server that will expose an API to access it, on the address `http://localhost:3000/`.

In a separate terminal, run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## ENJOY!
